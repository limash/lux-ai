# Lux-ai

The repository provides machine learning based solutions for the [Lux AI Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021) ([19th place of 1178: team shmyak](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2021/leaderboard)):
- Imitation agents use match records downlodaded through the Kaggle API to mimic the best players (supervised learning);
- Self-taught agents use reinforcement learning on self play matches.

The Lux AI Challenge is a competition where competitors design agents to tackle a multi-variable optimization, resource gathering, and allocation problem in a 1v1 scenario against other competitors.
In addition to optimization, successful agents must be capable of analyzing their opponents and developing appropriate policies to get the upper hand.
